You haven&#x27;t really decided, planned or booked anything, intending on winging everything.You have enough for food and water, and some spending money. What do you want to do now?

[[Find somewhere to stay]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Find somewhere to stay" tags="" position="494,374">You start wandering the streets of Cairns.
After spending most of the day looking around, you have found 3 suitable places to stay. They all require you to pay in full upon arrival.

Qwerty Motel cost $10pp. per night. It is very dirty and uncomfortable.
Potato Inn costs $30pp. per night. It is habitable.
Banana Hotel cost $50pp. per night. It is pretty nice.

[[Banana Hotel]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Qwerty Motel" tags="" position="236,366">You pay, then go up to your room. It is late, so you decide to call it a day. Later that night, quiet knocking at the door wakes you. What do you do?

[[Open the door]]

&quot;Officer, what is going on here?&quot; you manage to say, and he starts explaining everything. 

&quot;We thought that there would be a dangerous criminal housed here, but it seems he has left, as you look nothing like him. We apologise profusely for scaring you. Feel free to drop by the police station if you have any problems during your stay. Have a good evening.&quot;

He then leaves, letting you go back to sleep.

&quot;He&#x27;s your man, don&#x27;t you recognise him?&quot; the mercenaries reply.

&quot;No, he&#x27;s not,&quot; the boss replies, but seeing as he&#x27;s here, give him a choice.

The End

Tourism has both negative and positive effects on the Great Barrier Reef. Tourism helps generate revenue for local communities and for the upkeep of the Marine Park. Tourism can also help spread awareness about the importance of the delicate ecosystem of the reef. Tourism, however, can also have negative impacts on the natural reef environment. With more people in one area, the demand for natural resources increases. This can result in the overuse of natural resources as well as producing more waste and pollution. It is also hard to monitor the actions of tourists at all times. Some tourists do not obey the rules and damage the coral reef.

However, you are smart enough to notice the environmentally unfriendly chemicals and by-products of agriculture. You are not impressed by this. You return to your lodgings, and enjoy the rest of your stay in Cairns, before going home.

The End

Agriculture is also affecting the water condition of the oceans and the Great Barrier Reef region. Even though agricultural practices take place on the land, the cycle of water throughout the global environment causes problems for the reef ecosystem. Currently, about 80 percent of the land along the coast of the reef is used for cattle grazing and crop growing. Various pesticides, chemicals and fertilisers are often used on crops. Farming animals produces a lot of waste. These pollutants enter streams and river through surface run-off or soil infiltration. The rivers and streams then end in the ocean. Chemicals and pesticides are poisonous and can kill various life forms on the reef. Fertilisers and animal waste are high in phosphorous and nitrogen. These two nutrients are deadly to coral polyps.

Hint: Try for different endings</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Work in the mines" tags="" position="497,695">You are forced to work in illegal mines for the rest of your life. You have seen countless truckloads of soil and sediments, by-products of mining, being carried away, undoubtedly to somewhere unseen, and probably damaging to the environment. Unfortunately you never return to your lodgings, or go home.

The End

Currently, about 80 percent of the material dumped at sea is dredged material. Dredged material is dirt, sand and mud (sediment). Sediment has been eroded from land as a result of agriculture, urban development and deforestation. This sediment enters rivers and streams and is carried to the oceans. Sediment also enters the oceans through the natural process of erosion. The influx of sediment into the Great Barrier Reef region is blocking the clear waters. This makes the water cloudy, and it is then difficult for the zooxanthellae algae to undergo photosynthesis. If the algae cannot undergo photosynthesis, they will die. This will also cause the coral polyps to die since they rely on the algae to survive.

Other material dumped at sea includes metals, glass, plastics, wood, chemicals and nuclear waste. It is estimated that about seven billion tonnes of litter is put into the oceans every year. Over half of this is in various forms of plastic. Plastics, and other materials, can take several decades to decompose. Every year, about one million seabirds around the world die as a result of plastics. Plastics that are dumped into the oceans are circulated to other parts of the world through global currents. The plastics and various other materials are building up and harming not only the Great Barrier Reef but ocean ecosystems around the world.
